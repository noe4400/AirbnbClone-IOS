# Airbnb Clone App
The app replicates the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform, this project will include viewing property listings, searching for places to stay, and booking accommodations. This project demonstrates my skills in iOS development, including the use of Swift, SwiftUI, MVVM architecture, data persistence, and networking.
